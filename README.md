# Angular Filters

This project was generated using [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 21.0.4.

## Development server

To start a local development server, run:

```bash
ng serve
```

Once the server is running, open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.

## Task Details:

1. Fetch the events and their attributes for the filter from this endpoint: https://br-fe-assignment.github.io/customer-events/events.json
2. Focus on good component structure with reusability and clear data flow in mind.
3. Try to work iteratively towards a functional solution and make it as feature complete as possible.
4. A pixel perfect solution is not mandatory.
5. Log the data model into the console when the Apply filters button is clicked. We would like to see how you structure the data.
